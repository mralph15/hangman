### HANGMAN ASSIGNMENT

This repository is modified from an assignment required for Dr. Susan Rodger's Computer Science 101
course at Duke University completed in the Fall of 2020.

A general framework to implement was provided by the instructor as well as the list of words; however,
the body of the code is the student's work.

The Hangman.py file allows the player to play a standard game of hangman against the computer,
attempting to guess the computer's word in either easy (12 guesses) or hard (8 guesses) mode.

The CleverHangman.py file allows the player to play a game of hangman against the computer where
the computer is able to "cheat" and change the word on the player in order to make it more difficult
for them to guess its word. The player is able to choose the number of characters in the word in this
game. Additionally, if the game is played in debug mode, the player can see what word the computer
is switching from each round.

Instructions provided to the student on the assignment can be found at the following links:
